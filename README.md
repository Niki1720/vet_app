## VET APP

In this simple app I created an `API` with Rails. During  creating that app I have learnt how to provide response like `JSON` from my controller and how to serialize the models in my app.
Rails version `7.0`. Ruby version `3.1`

## Getting started
To get the Rails server running locally:

* Clone this repo
* `bundle install` to install all required dependencies
* `rake db:migrate` to make all database migrations
* `rails s` to start the local server

### Important controllers:
* `animals_controller`
* `users_controller`

### Resource
Table creation and model with validation:

* Users
* Messages

### Associations

* One-to-many between users and animals
